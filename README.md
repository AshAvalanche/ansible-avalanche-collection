# Ansible Avalanche Collection

Collection providing Ansible roles, playbooks and modules to manage [Avalanche](https://docs.avax.network/) nodes, subnets and blockchains.

## Why an Ansible collection for Avalanche?

Ava Labs provides [avalanche-network-runner](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-network-runner) to easily run a local test network (either locally or in Kubernetes).

This collection takes a different approach and provides tools for production environments. Those can also be used to bootstrap realistic test networks.

It aims at:

- **Provisioning Avalanche nodes** on Fuji or Mainnet with flawless upgrade capabilities. Ansible also brings easy node configuration persistence and idempotent deployments.
- **Bootstrapping local test networks** that really mimic production environments
- **Automating subnet and blockchain operations** (subnet whitelisting, plugin deployment) for validators
- And more

## Requirements

- Ansible >= 2.9 (see [Installing Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html))

## Supported versions

This collection has been tested to work with the following versions:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- AvalancheGo >= 1.7.0

## Installation

```sh
# With Ansible >= 2.10
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/AshAvalanche/ansible-avalanche-collection.git

# With Ansible 2.9
mkdir -p ansible_collections/ash
git clone https://github.com/AshAvalanche/ansible-avalanche-collection.git ansible_collections/ash/avalanche
```

## Getting started

The repository [ansible-avalanche-getting-started](https://github.com/AshAvalanche/ansible-avalanche-getting-started) provides examples of how to use the collection.

## Collection resources

### Modules

- [ash.avalanche.tx](./plugins/modules): submit a transaction to an Avalanche network

### Roles

- [ash.avalanche.node](./roles/node): install, configure and upgrade Avalanche nodes
- [ash.avalanche.subnet](./roles/subnet): create Avalanche subnets
- [ash.avalanche.blockchain](./roles/blockchain): create Avalanche blockchains

### Playbooks

- [ash.avalanche.bootstrap_local_network](./playbooks/bootstrap_local_network.yml): bootstrap a local test network (`--network-id=local`)
- [ash.avalanche.provision_nodes](./playbooks/provision_nodes.yml): provision nodes for Fuji or Mainnet (`--network-id=fuji|mainnet`)

## Inventory requirements

- `ash.avalanche.node`:
  - **All the nodes** on which to install AvalancheGo have to be in the `avalanche_nodes` group.
  - For local networks, **one of the nodes** has to be in the `bootstrap_node` group. This node has to **be started first to serve as a bootstrap node** for the others. For an example of how to do that, see the [bootstrap_local_network.yml](../../playbooks/bootstrap_local_network.yml) playbook.
- `ash.avalanche.subnet`:
  - **The node used to make API calls** have to be in the `subnet_control_node` group.
  - **The nodes to be added as validators** to the subnet have to be in the `subnet_validators` group. The Ansible host has to be able to connect to those nodes via SSH.
- `ash.avalanche.blockchain`:
  - **The node used to make API calls** have to be in the `subnet_control_node` group.
  - **The validators** of the subnet have to be in the `subnet_validators` group. The Ansible host has to be able to connect to those nodes via SSH.

## Roadmap

- [x] Avalanche transaction module
- [x] Subnet role
- [x] VMs management
- [x] Blockchain role
- [ ] TLS support
